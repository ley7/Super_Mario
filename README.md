**Attention:**<br>
The program should be run on Nexus 5X API 25(Android 7.1.1). This is because the code utilizes the screen length and width of the Nexus 5X as the map array for the game, and therefore if the user uses a different phone with a different screen size than the Nexus 5X, then the program will attempt to go out of bounds of an array for various objects in the game. <p>
Also, the pogramme don't support multi-touch. The user cannot simultaneously touch multi buttons. And the directional buttons must be pressed repeatedly instead of holding it like in tradtional platformers.

**Maneuvering the program:**
1) When opening the project, there is a possibility that the following error <br />  "\pathtousername\username\additionalpathstoproject\LeYuArronAssignment3-master does not exist" and the window that shows the error will prompt you to either get rid of them or keep them. You should get rid of them because ther error only appears when first downloading the project and does not appear again after getting rid of them. This error is because one team member merge two different name packages in the github, so the name is not unified. **It won't affect the program at all, just ignore it.** If you get the error that the git root is being called but does not exist, that just means that the user is not directly linked to the github respository or has configured any github related version controls to either the incorrect repository or has not configured it at all. Â <br />
2) The first time you open the project, **we recommend you clean the project using Build-Clean Project.** in  Android Studio. Because there are a lot trash files in the projects when we compile the programme, maybe the program can't be run properly if you don't clean them in your computer.
